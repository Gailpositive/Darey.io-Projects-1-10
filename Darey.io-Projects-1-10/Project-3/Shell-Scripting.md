# INTRODUCTION TO SHELL SCRIPTING AND USER INPUT
## "Prerequisites: I'll be using my Git Bash Terminal, Ubuntu Virtual Box and VSCODE Terminal"

* First, I mkdir 'shell-scripting and cd into the directory. 
* Created a file called 'user-input.sh with the 'touch' command.
* I executed the code 'code .'  to navigate to vscode terminal to input some block of codes. then back to my powershell.
* I execute './shell-scripting' to get the output in the image below.
* In addition, I run the command 'ls -al' to list the files to ensure it is executable.
