# INTRODUCTION TO SHELL SCRIPTING AND USER INPUT
# "Prerequisites: I'll be using my Git Bash Terminal, Ubuntu Virtual Box and VSCODE Terminal"

* First, I mkdir 'shell-scripting and cd into the directory. 
* Created a file called 'user-input.sh with the 'touch' command.
* I executed the code 'code .'  to navigate to vscode terminal to input some block of codes. then back to my terminal.
* I execute './shell-scripting' to get the output in the image below.
* In addition, I run the command 'ls -al' to list the files to ensure it is executable.

* On my vscode terminal, I executed a block of code. I enter the first line of operation of the script, 'shebang '#!' follow by the interpreter '/bin/bash' command.
* Insert a non executable comment annotation starting with the #.
* Enter the 'echo' command  to print the statement 'Enter your name'.
* Use the 'read' command to take input from my keyboard and assign it to a variable.
* Inserted another line of non executable annotation
* Use the 'echo' command to print 'Hello, follow with the $ sign and variable 'name'!, nice to meet you'
* Save and exit
