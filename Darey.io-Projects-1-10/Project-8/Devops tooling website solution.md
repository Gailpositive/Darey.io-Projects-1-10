# BUILDING A COMPREHENSIVE BUSINESS  WEBSITE SOLUTION AND INTEGRATION OF VARIOUS TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES.
## A THREE-TIER WEB APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE, A SINGLE REMOTE MYSQL DATABASE AND AN NFS SERVER AS SHARED BACKEND STORAGE FILES. 
## Solution Prerequisites: Infrastruction: AWS. Three-Tier Webservers Linux: Redhat.  Database Server: Ubuntu + Mysql (Preferable but I used Redhat).  Storage server: Redhat + NFS Server.  Programming language: PHP. Code Repository: Github.  
## NOTE: Not all storage is suitable, hence it is important to know the suitable storage solution for every use case. Such as: what data will be stored, in what format, how this data will be accessed, by whom, from where, how frequently etc. Based on theses questions, I will be able to choose the right suitable storage for my solution. 
## SELF STUDY:
* Network attach storage (NAS) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage
* Storage area network (SAN) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network, and related protocol like NFS(s), FTP, SMB, iSCSI.
* Block-level storage https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-level_storage and how it is used by cloud providers, and how it differs from Object Storage https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage.
* On the example of AWS services https://dzone.com/articles/confused-by-aws-storage-options-s3-ebs-amp-efs-explained, understand the difference between Block storage, Object storage and Network file system.
