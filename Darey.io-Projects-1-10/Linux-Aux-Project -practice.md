# LINUX PRACTICE PROJECT-1

## This is Linux practices project on the linux commands as a beginner. 

"In my ubuntu virtualbox, I executed the pwd command to see my present working directory and use the "ls" to list files in the pwd"

First, I attemted to create a directory named "project" using the mkdir command, it turned out the file already exited. i excuted the "ls" command to list the files and directories in the present working directory (pwd),which effectively displayed the entire directory listing. Continuing with my effort, I once again utilized the "mkdir command to create a directorycalled "linux_practice", only to realize that the file also already existed. Subsequently, my intent was to create a directory labeled "folder" but again, I encounteredthe issue of a pre-existingfile with that name. Furthering my endeavors, I endeavored to create a directory named "folder one" within another directory named "linux_practice." Regrettably, this action resulted in a "permission denied" message, indicating an access restriction. In a bid to overcome this obstacle, I executed the command "sudo linux_practice/folder_one," which prompted a request for password authentication, aligning with the concept of acting as a root user.

 I executed  the "ls" command to list the directories, and then I employed "cat" on the 'linux_practice' directory, revealing that it is indeed a directory itself. To establish a tree-like structure with parent and child folders, I executed the command "mkdir -p linux_practice/folder_one/folder_two/folder_three." After several unsuccessful attempts, I finally achieved success in creating the desired directory structure.
