# PROJECT BASE LEARNING LEARNING (PBL) :PROJECT 1-10

 Welcome to my documentation process with darey.io as a devOps/cloud engineer. These projects outlines both aux projects, introduction process into the world of web-stack development & deployment and technologies. 
 
 A more detailed implementation of these projects are stored in the repository.


 ## AUX PROJECT: BASIC GIT PROJECT
 The Git project serves as an introduction to Git Bash terminal and the GitHub version control system. Its purpose is to facilitate learning about GitHub, encompassing skills such as creating repositories, initializing them, creating branches, collaborating remotely effectively, and establishing connections with remote servers.
 
 Within this project, I was also introduced to various other terminals, including Windows PowerShell, Termius, and the command prompt and basic systax in markdown cheat sheet among others.
    
    
# PROJECT 1: LAMP STACK IMPLEMENTATION IN AWS
The "LAMP Stack Architecture" project offers an immersive introduction and practical experience within the realm of web servers.

This project revolves around hands-on learning, focusing on the construction and deployment of a web server through the utilization of LAMP stack technologies. The process involves establishing a Linux environment, configuring the Apache2 web server, overseeing MySQL database management, and crafting script code using PHP.

Furthermore, delving into the creation of a LAMP stack server provides an initial exposure to the AWS console. This journey entails establishing a remote connection to the LAMP web server via the AWS Ec2 instance free tier, effectively expanding one's understanding of cloud-based server management.
